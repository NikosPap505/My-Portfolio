# Hi there! 👋 I'm Nikos Papoutsis.

This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my journey as a junior full-stack developer. Built with Astro and styled with Tailwind CSS because I wanted something fast, modern, and actually fun to work with.

## Tech stuff for the curious

I went with Astro because honestly, it just makes sense for a portfolio. Super fast loading times, great developer experience, and it plays nicely with all the other tools I wanted to use.

**What's under the hood:**

- Astro 5.x
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- All deployed as a static site

## The pages

- **Home** - Where I say hello and show off my best stuff
- **About Me** - The real story behind the code
- **Contact** - Drop me a line if you want to chat!

## Let's connect!

I'm based in Patras, Greece 🇬🇷 and always excited to talk about code, learn new things, or just have a good conversation about anything.
